<!--We would like you to create a comment board. Attached are images of what we would like the project to look like.-->

<!--Requirements:-->
<!--Must use pure html, css, and javascript(jQuery is the only library/framework allowed).-->
<!--Users can create their own display name with their comment.-->
<!--Add the posts from newest to oldest(Newest post at the top).-->
<!--When a user clicks the delete button on a comment, remove that comment from the page.-->
<!--When a user clicks the edit button, allow the comment to be edited and change the original comment when submitted.-->
<!--The original post MUST be fixed on top of the page. Meaning when the user scrolls through the comments the original post("Trying to decide a career path? Programming is the move. Change my mind.") will stay on top of the comments and will always be shown.-->
<!--The same goes for the "creating a comment" section. Make sure it is fixed on the bottom of the page and stays on top of the comments as the user scrolls.-->

<!--Upload your code challenge to github and respond to this email with your repository link(Not a zip file).-->

<!--What we will be looking for:-->
<!--Clean and organized code-->
<!--All requirements being met-->
<!--Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-->
<!--Thank you for taking the time to complete this challenge. We look forward to your response.-->
